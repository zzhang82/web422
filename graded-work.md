## Graded work

This page has details about the graded work in WEB422, for the current academic term.

<br>

### Tests

We have planned six (6) tests during the term.

The duration of each test will be less than 20 minutes. Each test will be worth 10% of your final course grade. All tests will be hand-written, and will happen sometime during the class timeslot. The total value of all tests will be 50%.

If you miss a test, there is no opportunity to do a replacement test. However, absence due to illness or other reasons happen occasionally. As a result, you can miss up to one (1) test, without suffering the loss of grades.

The effect of this policy will be extended to all students. At the end of the course, your lowest test result will be discarded, leaving your best 5 results.

### Assignments

We have planned eight (6) assignments during the term.

Most assignments have a two-week lifetime. Most are independent of each other. If you do not submit an assignment by the due date, its grade is zero, and there is no opportunity to earn marks for a late submission.

Each assignment will be worth 10% of your final course grade. The total value of all assignments will be 50%. At the end of the course, the lowest assignment result will be discarded, leaving your best five results.

#### Submission Policy

* Assignments must be created as specified in the assignment specification
* Late Assignment submissions will not be accepted and will receive a **grade of zero (0)** if not complete by the due date
* Submitted assignments must run locally, ie: start up errors causing the assignment/app to fail on startup will result in a **grade of zero (0)** for the assignment.
* The lowest assignment will be dropped

**Important Note:** Posting your assignment solutions anywhere online (ie: stackoverflow, public gitHub repositories, etc.) constitutes a violation of Seneca College’s Academic Honesty Policy, ie:
“Knowingly helping another student to commit an act of cheating by letting him/her view your answers by lending your work or by working together on a project not specifically assigned and/or approved as a group effort. (Cheating)” ( [Seneca College Academic Honesty Policy – Appendix E](http://www.senecacollege.ca/academic-policy/appe.html) )

### Summary

**Make-up (replacement) tests? No.**

We don't do make-up or replacement tests, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* Tests are designed, in part, to encourage you to prepare for class before you walk into the room. Doing a test after the class has happened just doesn't make sense.

* Your lowest two test results are discarded before your final grade is calculated, so missing a test does not affect your final grade.

* Test answers are discussed during class, so doing a test after class is pointless.

Therefore, no make-up or replacement tests. 

<br>

**Due date extensions? No.**

We don't do due date extensions for assignments, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* They cause problems for other work that follows an assignment, because it leaves less time to complete the next piece of work.

* They take your attention away from new topics in this course. You're less receptive, or will ignore, new topics that follow the ones that are practiced on the assignment.

* A due date extension is disrespectful to other students in the course, because it tells them that the work they did to meet the due date doesn't have value.

* Finally a due date extension is disrespectful to other professors and their courses, because it takes your attention away from their coursework while you are working on late work.

Therefore, no due date extensions.
