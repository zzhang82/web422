## WEB422 Week 10 Notes

The theme for this week is to work with Angular forms. An app that interacts with users must use forms efficiently and effectively.  To this end, we focus on:

* Refreshing your memory by showing a simple and standard HTML Form.
* Followed by configuring an Angular app to use HTML forms

We will then discuss how to “bind”  data (using “two-way” binding) and “submit” the form

Finally, we will illustrate some of the special CSS classes Angular uses to automatically track the “state” of elements, ie: “untouched”, “dirty”, “invalid”, etc, followed by a quick discussion on Form Validation in Angular
